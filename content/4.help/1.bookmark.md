## Bookmarker's FAQ

- **What data will be exported?**:br Your data including play times, bookmarked anime, and latest watch history will be exported into one JSON file.
- **Where is the data stored?**:br Your data will be stored locally in your browser using localStorage.
- **Why not use the cloud?**:br I want to make amvstrm as local as possible and easier to self-host without the need for annoying environment configuration. Even though cloud saving gives us so many advantages, it is still annoying to set up and expensive once it grows.\:brFeel free to contribute or fork our repository if you want to rework or add authentication and more stuff to it.
- **Why i got an error when importing my data?** :br-we validate the file using ID from file name and ID inside the data.\`\`\`js \[bookmark.vue]
  const validateImportedData = (importedData, expectedBmkid) => {
  try {
  const data = JSON.parse(importedData);
  if (data.bmkid !== expectedBmkid) {
  throw new Error(
  `BMKID mismatch: expected ${expectedBmkid}, got ${data.bmkid}`
  );
  }
  return data;
  } catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
  return null;
  }
  };
